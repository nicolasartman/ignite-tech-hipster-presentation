#Technohipsterism: What, you haven't heard of it?

http://nicolasartman.github.com/ignite-tech-hipster-presentation/ignite/ignite.html

Slides are meant to run at 1024x768 and do not currently scale to other resolutions.

To turn off auto-advance push 'a'. To turn off transitions and automatically show all builds on slide load, push 't'. Push the key again to turn either of these back on (restarting auto-advance then requires returning to slide one. Restarting transitions requires moving to another slide).
